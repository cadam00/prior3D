## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

-   Corrected start of the description -\> Removed Toolset word.

-   Added \value to coherence.Rd.

-   Kept \dontrun{} only at the examples of coherence.Rd, Compare_2D_3D.Rd,
evaluate_3D.Rd, plot_3D.Rd, plot_Compare_2D_3D.Rd, prioritize_3D.Rd. The reason
is the use of commercial software required for running option
`portfolio = "gap"`.

## R CMD check results

0 errors \| 0 warnings \| 1 note

-   This is a new release.
