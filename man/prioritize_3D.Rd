3D prioritization algorithm
}
\arguments{
\item{split_features}{
\code{list} of SpatRaster objects representing depth zones, where each element corresponds to a
different depth level, ranging from surface to the bottom of the sea.
The function uses the output of the split_rast function, but other multilevel (3D)
distribution data that conform to this structure is also acceptable.
First list element corresponds to the shallowest distribution and the last list element to
the deepest one.
}
\item{depth_raster}{
SpatRaster object or file path with elevation/bathymetric map.
}
\item{breaks}{
Numeric vector defining the range of depth layers to use.
}
\item{biodiv_df}{
\code{data.frame} or a file path (CSV, TXT, XLS, or XLSX) containing additional
information about biodiversity features.
}
\item{priority_weights}{
\code{data.frame} object or file path (CSV, TXT, XLS, or XLSX) containing group names of
biodiversity features in the first column and corresponding group weights in the second
column. This data.frame attributes distinct prioritization weights to different
biodiversity features or groups of features.
}
\item{budget_percents}{
Numeric value \eqn{[0,1]} or vector containing budget percentages to use. The default is
\code{seq(0,1,0.1)}.
}
\item{budget_weights}{
Numeric weight vector for budget_percents allocation among depth levels.
Otherwise it can be a string with one of the choices \code{"equal"}, \code{"area"} or
\code{"richness"}.
Alternatively, it can be a numerical vector with custom weights corresponding to each
depth layer, where the first value corresponds to the surface and last one corresponds to
the bottom of the sea. The weights are normalized if their sum exceeds 1. If not
specified, an equal distribution of budget among depth levels is used, as the default.
}
\item{penalty}{
A single numeric penalty applied to each depth zone, as defined in the\cr
\code{prioritizr::add_boundary_penalties}.
}
\item{edge_factor}{
A single numeric edge factor applied to each depth zone, as defined in the\cr
\code{prioritizr::add_boundary_penalties}.
}
\item{gap}{
The optimality gap for the solver, as defined in the \pkg{prioritizr} package.
The default gap is 0.1.
}
\item{threads}{
The number of solver threads to be used. The default is 1.
}
\item{sep_priority_weights}{
Separator used in priority_weights file, if priority_weights is in path format.
}
\item{portfolio}{
The portfolio to be used, choosing between \code{"extra"},
\code{"gap"}, \code{"cuts"} and \code{"shuffle"} portfolios.
The default is \code{"gap"}. \code{portfolio=""} indicates that no portfolio is used.
For more about \code{portfolios} see \pkg{prioritizr}.
}
\item{portfolio_opts}{
The \pkg{prioritizr} portfolio options to be used.
}
\item{sep_biodiv_df}{
Separator used in biodiv_df file, if biodiv_df is in path format.
}
\item{locked_in_raster}{
An optional \code{locked_in_raster} SpatRaster to be used.
Note that these areas are considered as zero-cost.
}
\item{locked_out_raster}{
An optional \code{locked_out_raster} SpatRaster to be used.
Note that these areas are excluded from the solution.
}
\item{verbose}{
If \code{verbose = TRUE}, then solver messages are printed as well. The default is
\code{FALSE}.
}
}

\details{
This function is used to generate prioritization maps. Single budget settings
(ex. \code{total_budget = 0.3}) produce standard maps, as typical Marxan outputs.
Multiple budgets, by using a vector (ex. \code{c(0.1,0.3,0.5)}, result in
cumulative (frequency) maps, illustrating areas selected by various budget levels.
Although this output follows a different approach, it resembles to typical Zonation
output maps.

The main reason for \code{biodiv_df} here is defining prioritization weights for features.
In this package weights are defined per group of features (if needed). \code{biodiv_df}
has \code{mandatory} column names (and any other names are ignored):
\itemize{
\item{\code{"species_name"}}: \bold{Mandatory} column with the feature names, which must
be the same with \code{split_rast}.
\item{\code{"group"}}: \bold{Mandatory} column with the group weights names.
}

Except from \code{biodiv_df}, an additional \code{data.frame} object can also be used,
named \code{priority_weights}. If used, this \code{data.frame} object must have two
columns:
\itemize{
\item{\code{"group"}}: \bold{Mandatory} column with the group weights names.
\item{\code{"weight"}}: \bold{Mandatory} column with the group weights.
}

In case that no feature weights are desired, then \code{biodiv_df} and
\code{priority_weights} can be both kept to \code{NULL}.

\code{breaks} must be in correspondance to depth_raster file.
For example, if depth_raster has range \eqn{[10, -3000]}, then a breaks vector of
\code{c(0,-40,-200,-2000,-Inf)} will create depth levels
\eqn{[0,-40],\\(-40,-200], (-200, -2000], (-2000, -\infty)}
and set to NA cells with values greater than \eqn{10}.

\code{budget_percents}: Budget reflects the desired level of protection to be modeled.
It ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no resources available for protection,
while 1 signifies resources sufficient to protect the entire study area. Typically,
setting a budget of 0.3 corresponds to the 30\% conservation target (i.e. 30\% of the
total area set aside for conservation).
Users also have the flexibility to define multiple budget levels using a vector,
allowing for the exploration of various protection scenarios. For instance, a vector like
\code{c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5)} represents three scenarios where 10\%, 30\%, and 50\% of the
study area are designated for protection.

\code{budget_weights}: The \bold{prioritize_3D} function allows users to specify how the
budget is distributed among depth levels. Three allocation methods are available:
\enumerate{
\item{Equal Distribution: Allocates an equal share of the budget to each depth level\cr
(\code{budget_weights = "equal"}).}
\item{Proportional to Area: Allocates budget based on the spatial extent of each depth\cr
level (\code{budget_weights = "area"}).}
\item{Proportional to Species Richness: Prioritizes budget allocation to depth levels with
higher species diversity (number of species) (\code{budget_weights = "richness"})}.
}
Otherwise, it can be a numeric vector with length equal to the number of depth levels,
where each number indicates the budget share per depth level.

The solver used for solving the prioritization problems is the best available on the
computer, following the solver hierarchy of \pkg{prioritizr}.
